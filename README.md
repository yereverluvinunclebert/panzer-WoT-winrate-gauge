A Dieselpunk Win Rate widget - I created for the World of Tanks and War Thunder 
communities.This Panzer widget is a simple Win Rate gauge. Functional 
and gorgeous at the same time. The graphics are my own, I took original 
inspiration from a clock face by Italo Fortana.

To find out how the widget operates, simply right click and select Help and a 
full explanation of all the buttons and windows is shown. Hovering over any 
control should supply a pop-up explaining each function.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget 
will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run 
it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such and then pop 
up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget 
takes command line-style commands for windows.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.

 Running the widget using a javascript engine frees javascript from running only 
 within the captivity of a browser, you will now be able to run these widgets on 
 your Windows desktop as long as you have the correct widget engine installed.

Configuration with World of Tanks
  ========================================================
  
 Enter your username and numeric user ID (if you know it) when prompted.
 
 First issue: You will need your numeric user ID. You can get that from here:
 https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://worldoftanks.com/en/community/accounts/#wot&at_search=
 Just enter your own username into the field there and hit enter.
 
 eg. https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://worldoftanks.com/en/community/accounts/#wot&at_search=yereverluvinunclebert
 
 When you hit return, on the browser page that just opened, click on your 
 username (in green) where it says "battles, victories, experience"
 
 > yereverluvinunclebert < 16,688 55.17% 5,694,590
 
 and on the resulting page in the URL bar at the top you will see your user ID. 
 It will be something like:
 
 https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://worldoftanks.com/en/community/accounts/1003670189-yereverluvinunclebert/
 
 - Type the number you find here (eg. 1003670189)
 
 That is your user ID. Open the widget Preferences, type it into the widget and 
 hit Enter. If it is a valid ID then after a few seconds the gauge will obtain 
 and register your win rate and indicate your noobness/unicumness.
